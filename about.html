  <h1>About This Space</h1>

  <p>This space was created to support families, educators, therapists, and allies in deepening their understanding of autism through an autistic-informed, neurodiversity-affirming lens. It exists to uplift autistic voices and advocate for more just, supportive, and inclusive environments—especially for autistic children and their families.</p>

  <p>So much of what professionals learn about autism is rooted in pathologizing frameworks. Teacher preparation programs, therapy models, and early childhood systems often frame autistic behavior through a deficit-based lens—focusing on what children lack rather than how they communicate, connect, and experience the world.</p>

  <p>This space aims to challenge those assumptions and build something better.</p>

  <p>We are committed to honoring autistic identity, pushing back against harmful narratives, and sharing insights grounded in advocacy, lived experience, and community care. While this work is currently led by one individual drawing from academic, activist, and personal learning, it is growing toward deeper collective engagement.</p>

  <p>If you’re new here, welcome. You’re invited to reflect, unlearn, and reimagine alongside us.</p>
